Example Arch apps to learn from

## Contributing

If you have an example Arch application you want to share, open a pull request to add it to this repository as a new directory in the root directory.

The only thing we ask is for the examples to be written in both LiveScript and ES6 (but feel free to open the pull request early even when you just have one).

## Ideas for example code

We maintain a list of code example ideas in the main reposotory. Check [this issue](https://github.com/arch-js/arch/issues/69).
